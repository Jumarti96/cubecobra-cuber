# /build-deck — Cube Deck Builder

Build a deck from a locally cached cube in any supported format. Cards must come only from the cube pool. A self-grill gate runs before the final list is shown. The deck is saved as deck.json, deck.tsv, deck.mwDeck, and analysis.md in a per-deck subfolder when you confirm.

**You build the deck.** You investigate the cube, build, and repair. A two-agent self-grill audits the finished list before you show it to the user.

Read the IRON RULE and the counts principle before doing anything — they bind every phase.

---

## IRON RULE — Oracle Text Or It Didn't Happen

**Never assume what a card does from prior knowledge.**
Every inclusion and justification MUST cite `oracle_text` from the working pool cache (`_workspace/<run-token>/working_pool.json`). The Phase 9 agents cite oracle text from the grill input bundle (`_workspace/<run-token>/grill_input.json`).
If the oracle text does not support the stated role, the card must be replaced.

---

## The Counts Principle — Counts, Not Adjectives

No card is good or bad in isolation. Any claim that a card is weak, strong, a trap, a must-include, or "not worth the slot" **when its value depends on how many other cards qualify** must be stated as an actual count against **this** deck's list — a numerator and a denominator — not as an adjective.

> WEAK:  "This cost reducer only reduces generic mana, so it's marginal here."
> STRONG: "This cost reducer reduces generic mana; 16 of the 24 nonland cards in this list have a generic component. INCLUDE."

This binds every card whose value is a function of how many others qualify: cost reducers, tribal and type-matters payoffs, storm and spell-count triggers, graveyard counts, devotion, threshold, metalcraft, delirium, domain, affinity. Compute the count from the list you actually built; if the list changes, recount.

---

## Phase Protocol — The Orchestrator Is The Gate

**The run is tracked by `cuber/orchestrator.py`, not by your own discipline.** Every phase records a JSON artifact in `runs/<run_id>/`; export is blocked by a PreToolUse hook until `phase_09_grill.json` exists and validates. You do not decide whether a gate was satisfied — the orchestrator does, and it can refuse you.

**Read `references/orchestrator.md` at Phase 0 start.** It holds the full command reference.

At the start of every build:

```
python -m cuber.orchestrator init --cube <cube-id>
```

Then, after each phase's work is genuinely done, record it — with the phase's real start/end times and, for subagent phases, the actual returned reports:

```
python -m cuber.orchestrator record <run_id> <phase> --mode subagent \
    --payload-file  _workspace/<run-token>/payload.json \
    --subagents-file _workspace/<run-token>/subagents.json
```

**Phase 5B and Phase 9 will not record with `--mode inline`, and will not record with fewer than two subagent results.** The orchestrator rejects the write; there is no flag that relaxes this. Recording them means pasting each agent's real report (with its BEGIN/END markers, ≥200 chars) under a distinct `dispatch_id`.

### When a subagent dispatch fails

API session limit, credit exhaustion, tool error, malformed report — **any** failure, no exceptions:

```
python -m cuber.orchestrator fail <run_id> <phase> --error "<what actually happened>"
```

This writes `phase_XX.FAILED.json`, writes no passing artifact, and exits non-zero. Then **STOP and report the failure to the user.** Do not run a mechanical check inline and call the phase done. Do not hand-write an artifact. Do not proceed to export — the hook will block it anyway, and trying is worse than stopping.

A `FAILED` marker blocks the phase until an explicit `--retry`, which archives the failure rather than erasing it. The failure stays in the run directory permanently.

### Resuming

```
python -m cuber.orchestrator resume <run_id>
```

Prints every phase as PASS / FAILED / INVALID / pending with the reason, and names the phase to restart from. Use it whenever a session is interrupted or you are unsure what actually ran.

### Announce, then work

**Every phase opens with a banner line to the user, before any phase work:**

> ▶ Phase <N> — <phase name>

No banner, no phase. The banner is written the moment the phase begins — not retroactively, not batched with the next one. A phase whose banner never appeared is a phase that was skipped.

**Subagent protocol (the Phase 5B sketchers + judge and the Phase 9 agents):**

1. When dispatching, announce it: `⏳ Dispatching Proposer + Challenger`.
2. Every dispatch prompt mandates that the agent's report **open** with `=== <ROLE> REPORT — BEGIN ===` and **close** with `=== <ROLE> REPORT — END ===`.
3. When a report returns, verify **both** markers are present before using anything in it. A report missing either marker is incomplete — announce that and re-dispatch that agent; never adjudicate from a partial report.
4. After the check passes, announce: `✔ <role> report verified`.
5. Save each report verbatim into the phase's `--subagents-file` and record the phase. The orchestrator re-checks the markers; a report that fails step 3 will also fail the record.

---

## Prerequisites

```
cuber fetch <id>
cuber enrich <id>
cuber tag <id>       ← required; taxonomic_profile drives pipeline discovery
```

Phase 2 builds/loads the **cube dossier** (`cuber dossier <id>`) for you — it does not need to be run by hand first.

---

## Supported Formats

| Format | Deck Size | Commander | Sideboard default |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| `40-card` | 40 cards | No | 8 cards |
| `60-card` | 60 cards | No | 15 cards |
| `commander-60` | 61 cards (60 + 1 commander) | 1 or 2 partners | Optional |
| `commander-100` | 101 cards (100 + 1 commander) | 1 or 2 partners | Optional |

---

## Reference Files (read at phase start)

Detailed mechanics live in `references/` under this skill's base directory. **At the start of each phase listed below, read the named file before executing that phase.** The rules in this file always apply; the references hold the JSON shapes, tables, and format specs.

| File | Read at |
|------|---------|
| `references/orchestrator.md` | Phase 0 start (run tracking + gates) |
| `references/workspace-and-pool.md` | Phase 0 start |
| `references/discovery.md` | Phase 2 start (covers Phases 2–4) |
| `references/build.md` | Phase 5 start (covers Phases 5–6b) |
| `references/challenger-template.md` | Phase 9 start |
| `references/render-and-save.md` | Phase 10 start (covers Phases 10–11) |

---

## Phase 0: Card Pool Definition

### Workspace Setup

Run at the very start of Phase 0, before any user prompts or analysis:

**Read `references/workspace-and-pool.md` now.** Mint the run token by running the command in its steps 1–3 — it atomically creates `_workspace/<run-token>/`, handles collisions by retrying, and must never be done by hand or with `exist_ok=True`.

Every file this run writes — the working pool cache, the grill input bundle, every temp Python script, every intermediate audit/dump — goes inside `_workspace/<run-token>/`, never at `_workspace/` root and never at the repo root. Concurrent runs each get their own token, so they can never read or overwrite each other's files.

Do not delete anything outside your own `_workspace/<run-token>/` directory.

### Pool Restrictions

Ask the user (in natural language):
> "Are there any pool restrictions? For example: up to 2 copies of commons and uncommons, only certain rares, or specific cards to exclude. Press Enter to use the full cube mainboard."

If the user provides no restrictions, proceed immediately with the full cube mainboard.

**Basic lands are format-supplied.** The pool always includes an unlimited supply of the five basic lands (Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, Forest), whether or not the cube list contains them — unless the user explicitly restricts basics. Never inspect other files to check whether basics are in the cube; `dossier.mana_infrastructure.basics_in_pool` is informational only. When the cube lacks them, add them to the working pool per `references/workspace-and-pool.md`.

Infer the `card_pool_rules` object from the answer — the JSON shape and field semantics are in `references/workspace-and-pool.md`.

**Display the inferred `card_pool_rules` and ask the user to confirm before proceeding.** If the user corrects the inferred object, update it and re-display. Proceed only after explicit confirmation.

Once confirmed, pass `card_pool_rules` to `cube_search.load_merged_pool(id, card_pool_rules=...)`. All subsequent phases use this filtered pool exclusively.

### Working Pool Cache

After loading the filtered pool, write `_workspace/<run-token>/working_pool.json`. Track this path — all subsequent phases reference it. (Per-card field lists, the load-bearing `tags`/`mana_cost` note, and the `export_meta.json` capture for Phase 11 are in `references/workspace-and-pool.md`.)

**Do not read `enriched.json` after Phase 0 completes.** All card data for Phases 2–9 comes from the working pool cache and the bundle derived from it.

---

## Phase 1: Interview

Use AskUserQuestion to collect decisions before any analysis. Ask in a single multi-part message where possible.

**Required:**
1. **Cube** — short ID or slug (or list available cubes from `cubes/*/meta.json`)
2. **Format** — 40-card / 60-card / Commander-60 / Commander-100
3. **Colors** *(optional)* — any color preference? Default is pool-derived; say "surprise me" or leave empty to let strategy discovery determine colors from the winning pipeline
4. **Intent** — how do you want to play? Choose one:
   - `Competitive` — maximize win consistency, interaction density
   - `Experimental` — unusual synergies, high variance, cross-archetype overlap
   - `Fun / Niche` — most distinctive or uncommon win condition in the pool
   - `Specific Constraint` — describe your constraint (e.g., "I want to play around Grapeshot")
5. **Power level** — casual / unpowered / powered / competitive

**Optional (ask but accept empty):**
6. **Sideboard size** — accept format default or specify

Note: card pool restrictions were collected in Phase 0. Do not re-ask them here.

---

## Phase 2: Deck Identity (Discovery)

Load card data from the working pool cache: `_workspace/<run-token>/working_pool.json`. Do not call `cube_search.load_merged_pool` or read `enriched.json`.

### Step 0: The Cube Dossier

**Run this first, before discovery.** The dossier is the deck-independent truth about the cube — colour distribution, mana infrastructure (with per-pair fixing counts), structural censuses (rituals, sweepers, sacrifice outlets, cost reducers, tutors), tribal rosters, and a threat profile of what the cube's *other* decks do. It warm-starts your investigation and is what the sideboard is built against.

```
cuber dossier <id>
```

This writes/loads `cubes/<slug>/dossier.json` and prints a summary. It is **cached per cube** and invalidated automatically when the cube changes, so on a repeat run it is nearly free. Pass `--rebuild` to force recomputation.

**Read `references/discovery.md` now.** It holds the census key table and its reading caveats, the fixing score derivation, the colour-count escalation rules, the optional interaction-chain aid, pipeline discovery, splash evaluation, and commander selection.

**Do not re-derive census facts by hand.** If you find yourself sweeping the pool for rituals, counting duals, or tallying a tribe, the answer is already in the dossier. But **never trust a 0-match as an impossibility** (`census_caveat`), and **verify each named dual/manland against its oracle text** before trusting the fixing count — a colourless manland is not colored fixing.

### Step 2: Pipeline Discovery

Run **Pipeline Discovery** per `references/discovery.md`: find payoff candidates, validate cluster support against the viability threshold, and build a ranked shortlist of 3–5 viable pipelines, each retained as a structured object with an oracle-grounded `thesis` (`kill_mechanism`, `goldfish_turn`, `default_role`).

---

## Phase 3: Strategy Selection

Present the shortlist to the user. For each pipeline entry display:
- Payoff card name and its synergy cluster(s)
- Supporting card count (Enabler/Fodder + Engine/Outlet in the cluster)
- Color identity of the pipeline's core cards
- Fixing score for that color combination

**Highlight the top recommendation** (marked clearly, based on intent ranking). If the user had no color preference in Phase 1, show the recommended pipeline's color identity as the suggested default.

Ask the user to accept the top recommendation, pick a different pipeline from the shortlist, or describe their own constraint (you construct and validate a pipeline anchored to it).

Lock the selected pipeline. **Carry the full shortlist forward — it will be used for re-evaluation in Phase 9 if needed.** The shortlist is never recomputed.

### Splash Evaluation

Run the deterministic splash filter in `references/discovery.md`. It sets `splash_colors` and the bounded `splash_candidates` list (at most 3 names per splash colour) — a splash colour never admits its whole colour, only these named cards.

---

## Phase 4: Commander Selection (Commander formats only)

Skip for 40-card and 60-card formats. Follow the procedure in `references/discovery.md`. The union of the selected commanders' `color_identity` becomes the binding colour constraint for all non-land cards.

---

## Phase 5: Deck Build

You build the deck. **Read `references/build.md` now.** It holds the seven-step build procedure, the slot-allocation table, the land-count modifiers, the pip-source math, the lightweight sweep shape, and the Phase 6b invocation.

### Phase 5A — Lightweight Sweep

Before committing the list, record a short sweep so no strong card is silently skipped and the analysis can show what was considered:
- **INCLUDE candidates** — cards you are building from, each with a one-line oracle-grounded reason scoped to this pipeline.
- **Considered but excluded** — a *bounded* list (not every pool card) of cards a reader would expect you to run but you rejected, each with a one-line mechanism reason. Count-dependent rejections obey the Counts Principle.

The considered-but-excluded entries become the `### CARDS CONSIDERED BUT EXCLUDED` section of the analysis. The sweep shape is in `references/build.md`.

### Phase 5B — Build

Build from the INCLUDE candidates. For each card, its oracle text (from the working pool cache) must support the role you assign; if it does not, the card does not go in.

**Before you classify, run Step 0 — sketch → judge → lock (every build):** pin the `archetype_family` from the locked `thesis.default_role` + Phase 1 intent, assign 2–3 build **lenses**, and dispatch **one independent, pool-blind sketcher subagent per lens, in parallel** (subagent protocol above) — each blind to the others and building only from the `include_candidates` slice. Then an independent, pool-blind **shape judge** picks one **build**; lock it, and carry its `weak_keystones` and rejected-build **harvest** into FILL. The three sketches are builds of ONE archetype, not competing archetypes. Breaks a greedy single-commit that varies run-to-run and blind-spots viable builds. Mechanics in `references/build.md`.

Then follow the numbered steps in `references/build.md`: **0 SKETCH→JUDGE→LOCK → 1 CLASSIFY (lock the selected) → 2 ALLOCATE SLOTS → 3 LAND COUNT → 4 MANA SOURCES → 5 FILL (+ harvest) → 6 COUNT-DEPENDENT VERDICTS → 7 record `build_output`**.

### Phase 5C — Pre-flight Validation (deterministic)

Write `_workspace/<run-token>/_tmp_validate_build.py` and run the light checks in `references/build.md` (deck size, exact-name membership, copy limits, colour identity, splash cap). Every check is a string or number comparison. Fix any failure directly, then re-run until all pass. Do not proceed with a failing check.

---

## Phase 6: Mana Audit Gate

Convert the mainboard into card dicts (join `name` against the working pool cache).

Run `deck_audit.mana_audit(deck_cards, format, commander_cards, core_colors=core_colors, splash_colors=splash_colors)`.
Display the report using `deck_audit.format_audit_report(audit)`.

**If audit result is FAIL:**
- Adjust land count toward the recommended target
- Re-balance producing lands if a color gap > 15pp exists
- Replace non-producing utility lands with on-color duals from the pool
- Re-run the audit after adjustments; log all swaps made

**If audit result is WARN:** note the issue, proceed without blocking.
**If audit result is PASS:** proceed.

Do not show the deck to the user or spawn the grill until the audit is at least WARN.

---

## Phase 6b: Structural Gate

Run the structural checks (the deck-building methodology, mechanized — thresholds live in `cuber/deck_checks.py`, never re-derive them by hand). The invocation snippet, the `role_counts` reliability-weighting rules, and the `coverage_declaration` construction are in `references/build.md`.

**Gate tiers:**
- **HARD — treat like a mana-audit FAIL:** `assembly` (an engine role's P(seen by thesis turn) < 0.75 — either add functional copies, or the thesis turn was optimistic: revise it and say so) and `coverage` (missing class, phantom card name, empty concession). Repair and re-run. Assembly counts **reliability-weighted** copies: a conditional functional copy is declared at a weight below one with its mechanism, never counted as a full copy.
- **WARN-tier — respond, don't rebuild:** `curve` and `goldfish`. Each WARN flag gets one line in `build_output.structural_responses` stating the mechanism-grounded reason the deviation is accepted.

**Also record `build_output.failure_modes`** — all six modes, none omitted: **flood**, **screw**, **decapitation**, **gas-out**, **raced**, **disruption-fizzle**. Each entry is exactly one of two shapes: a `mitigation` (mechanism-grounded, naming the cards or plan that address it) or an `accepted` (stating explicitly what mitigating would cost the deck's identity or winning plan). There is no third shape. Mode definitions and the JSON spec are in `references/build.md`. The Challenger reviews every entry as a checklist (its item 12); an entry it cannot accept is a BLOCKING finding.

Store the full report as `build_output.structural_checks`. It ships in the grill bundle.

---

## Phase 7: Sideboard

Skip if the user opted out or if the format does not normally use sideboards.

Default sizes: 8 (40-card), 15 (60-card), custom (commander).

A sideboard answers the **REST OF THE CUBE**, not your own deck. Work from `dossier.threat_profile` (what other decks in this cube actually do) and the rest of the cube's cards:
- **Hate cards**: match real threat classes in this cube (graveyard, artifacts, sweepers…) — cite oracle text for each, and state which threat class it answers
- **Flex slots**: cards that improve in certain matchups; explain what they answer and when to board them in
- Note any threat class the pool gives your colours no answer to

All sideboard cards come from the pool and count against combined copy limits.

---

## Phase 8: Grill Input Bundle

Write `_workspace/<run-token>/grill_input.json`.

The bundle contains:
- `deck`: array of all mainboard + sideboard cards, each with `name`, `oracle_text`, `colors`, `color_identity`, `cmc`, `type_line`, `rarity`, `role` (from Phase 5), and `board`
- `audit`: the mana audit result object from Phase 6
- `card_pool_rules`: the confirmed pool rules object from Phase 0
- `restrictions_checklist`: the compliance checklist from Phase 5
- `build_output`: your recorded derivation — `macro_archetype`, `deck_identity`, `thesis_turn`, `default_role`, `slot_allocation`, `skeleton_selection` (the Step-0 sketch → judge → lock record), `land_math`, `pip_math`, `coverage`, `failure_modes`, `structural_checks`, `structural_responses`. This lets the grill audit the **derivation**, not just the list.
- `validation_report`: the Phase 5C check results (all PASS by the time you get here)
- `working_pool`: the full working pool array from the cache — the grill's evidence base and what its absence audit scans
- `dossier`: the cube dossier (for the threat-profile sideboard and interaction checks)

Both Phase 9 agents read only this file — never `enriched.json`, the working pool cache, or any other cube data file.

---

## Phase 9: Self-Grill (Hard Gate)

**Read `references/challenger-template.md` now.** Spawn the two agents it describes — a Proposer that defends every card with an oracle quote, and a Challenger that attacks the deck independently and runs the full checklist (membership, oracle, restrictions, identity fit, better alternatives, proportional validation, sideboard cohesion, mana re-run, **derivation audit**, **absence audit**, pipeline viability, and **failure-mode review**). Neither agent sees the other's output during generation. Both dispatches and both returned reports follow the subagent protocol in **Phase Protocol** — verify the BEGIN/END markers before adjudicating.

**If either dispatch fails for any reason** — API session limit, credit exhaustion, tool error, a report missing its markers after a re-dispatch — run `python -m cuber.orchestrator fail <run_id> phase_09_grill --error "<what happened>"` and **stop.** Report it to the user. There is no inline substitute for this phase: a mechanical check you run yourself is not a second independent agent, and recording it as one is fabrication. The orchestrator will not accept `--mode inline` here and the export hook will block the save regardless.

**On success**, record the phase with both verbatim reports:
```
python -m cuber.orchestrator record <run_id> phase_09_grill --mode subagent \
    --subagents-file _workspace/<run-token>/grill_subagents.json \
    --payload-file  _workspace/<run-token>/grill_adjudication.json
```

### Resolve Grill (you adjudicate)

You built this deck, so you defend it and judge the Challenger's findings. Every finding arrives tagged by the Challenger as **BLOCKING** (the deck cannot finalize while it stands) or **ADVISORY** (yours to decide on the merits). Resolution is a table, a repair, an approval round, and a gate — in that order:

**1. The Resolution Table (required artifact — display it to the user).** One row per Challenger finding, no finding without a row:

| # | Finding | Severity | Decision | Grounds |
|---|---------|----------|----------|---------|

- `Severity` is the Challenger's tag, copied verbatim — never downgraded by you.
- `Decision` is `IMPLEMENT` or `CONTEST`.
- Hard findings — a legality violation (a Phase 5C check), a mana-audit regression (audit falls below WARN), a structural-gate HARD failure, a count that fails to reproduce — are always BLOCKING and always `IMPLEMENT`: repair, never rebuttal.
- A BLOCKING finding may be CONTESTed only with an oracle quote or a reproduced count in `Grounds`. "Marginal", "fine as is", and other adjectives are not grounds. An absence finding naming a card whose oracle-grounded count you cannot rebut is `IMPLEMENT`.
- ADVISORY findings: decide on the merits with one-line grounds — verify each claim against oracle text first. No approval needed.

**2. Repair the deck yourself.** Apply every `IMPLEMENT` row, recount any count-dependent verdict whose denominator moved, then re-run the Phase 5C validator, the Phase 6 audit, and the Phase 6b gate on the result.

**3. Approval round** (skip only when the Challenger reported zero BLOCKING findings). Send the Resolution Table plus the updated deck list back to the **same Challenger agent** (SendMessage — its context is intact; do not spawn a fresh one). It returns a verdict per BLOCKING finding: RESOLVED or UNRESOLVED with a one-line reason. Any UNRESOLVED verdict → one more repair + review round. **Cap: two review rounds.** BLOCKING findings still UNRESOLVED after round two are escalated to the user with both sides' reasoning; the user rules.

**4. Finalization gate.** Phase 10 is reachable only when every BLOCKING finding is RESOLVED — or the user has ruled on it — AND the final list satisfies: every card in the cube + oracle text supports every role + audit ≥ WARN + Phase 5C all-PASS + Phase 6b HARD gates pass.

### Re-evaluation Path

Trigger, and only this trigger: the Challenger states **"This pipeline cannot achieve its stated win condition with the available card pool."** (Not a mana issue. Not a ratio issue. Not a card-swap issue.) Verify the claim against the pool's oracle text; if it stands:

1. Log the rejection: `{ "payoff_card": "<name>", "verdict": "PIPELINE_NOT_VIABLE" }`.
2. Select the **next pipeline** from the Phase 3 shortlist. Do NOT re-run discovery or Phase 2.
3. Rebuild from Phase 5, re-running Phases 6–9.

If the shortlist is exhausted:
> "All shortlisted pipelines were rejected. Options: (1) Restart Phase 0 to adjust pool rules. (2) Lower the viability threshold and rerun discovery."

Wait for user guidance before proceeding.

---

## Phase 10: Present Final Deck

Display the deck using the enforced format. **Section order is strict — do not reorder.**

**Read `references/render-and-save.md` now.** It holds the display template, the format rules (including: **no Scryfall links, no external links of any kind, card names as plain text everywhere**), and the Phase 11 file specs.

**Header counts are derived, then verified.** Every section header carries a count (`## MAINBOARD (24 spells + 16 lands = 40)`, `### CREATURES (13)`). Compute each from the deck arrays at render time — never hand-write it, never copy it from a previous version. After writing `analysis.md`, re-parse it and confirm every section's summed `Qty` matches its header and that the file contains zero occurrences of `scryfall`.

Ask: **"Save this deck? [y/N]"**

---

## Phase 11: Save

**Step 0 — GATE STATUS (mandatory; print before writing ANY file).** Do not compose this table from memory. Run the orchestrator and paste its output verbatim:

```
python -m cuber.orchestrator resume <run_id>
```

It prints every phase as `PASS` / `FAILED` / `INVALID` / `pending`, with the reason for anything not `PASS`, read off the artifacts on disk. That is the gate status — your recollection of the run is not evidence, and a phase you *believe* passed but never recorded shows as `pending`, which is the correct answer.

**If the command exits non-zero, STOP. Do not write any file.** Show the user the table, name the incomplete gate(s), and hand it to them — they decide whether to re-run the gate or override. Never hand-write an artifact to turn a row green, and never save "the deck is fine anyway."

The export attempt is independently blocked by the PreToolUse hook (`scripts/gate_export.py`), so a deck write with a bad grill fails whether or not you run this step. Run it anyway — a blocked write mid-save is a worse experience than an honest table.

On confirmation, prompt for a deck name if not already provided. Sanitize to a filesystem-safe slug (lowercase, alphanumeric + hyphens).

All four files go into a single subfolder: `cubes/<id>/decks/<name>/`

File-by-file specs — the `deck.json` schema, `deck.tsv` columns, `exporter.write_mwdeck`, and the `analysis.md` frontmatter and section structure — are in `references/render-and-save.md`.

Confirm all four paths:
```
Saved:
  cubes/<id>/decks/<name>/deck.json
  cubes/<id>/decks/<name>/deck.tsv
  cubes/<id>/decks/<name>/deck.mwDeck
  cubes/<id>/decks/<name>/analysis.md
```

### Post-save — REJECTED & RISKY (mandatory; print after every save)

Printed to the user in chat, after the four paths. Not written to any file. Three parts, always all three, in order. This is a candour report, not a defence of the build — you have already saved; nothing here is a sales pitch.

**1. Five highest-power pool cards NOT in the deck.** Rank by raw card power **within the working pool** (`_workspace/<run-token>/working_pool.json`) restricted to `core_colors` + `splash_colors` — the whole pool, not just the Phase 5A `include_candidates`, and not the Phase 9 absence-audit list. There is no power rating in the data; judge it from `oracle_text` and say so. One sentence of rejection reason each, and the reason must be about THIS deck (wrong axis, unfeedable cost, off-curve, pip demand the mana base cannot serve), not a generic slight. If a card was cut for no reason you can defend, say **"no principled reason"** — that is a legitimate and expected entry, not a failure.

**2. Every general heuristic you applied, with its local justification.** One row per heuristic — land count, curve shape, protection/interaction counts, ramp count, removal density, colour ratios, anything you reached for as a rule of thumb. Each needs the specific card text or the actual math from THIS list that justifies it here (per the Counts Principle: numerator/denominator against the deck you built). A heuristic you cannot ground in this deck's cards is reported as ungrounded — write **"no principled reason — applied as a default"**. Do not construct a post-hoc rationalization to fill the cell; an honest ungrounded row is the point of the section.

**3. What you are genuinely unsure about.** Open questions, judgement calls that could have gone the other way, thin spots you accepted, counts near a threshold, anything the grill resolved by argument rather than by evidence. If you are genuinely unsure of nothing, say so plainly — but check first: a build with zero uncertainty is rarer than it feels.

Never soften an entry to make the deck look better, and never omit a part because it would be short.

## Tool Selection Table

| Task | Tool / File |
|------|-------------|
| Load card pool (with pool rules) | `cube_search.load_merged_pool(id, card_pool_rules=...)` — Phase 0 only |
| **Build / load the cube dossier** | `cuber dossier <id>` — Phase 2 Step 0. Cached per cube; `--rebuild` to force |
| **Mana infrastructure, fixing score** | `dossier.mana_infrastructure.duals_by_pair` — use the `free` count. Verify named lands against oracle before trusting it |
| **Rituals, sweepers, sac outlets, tutors** | `dossier.structural_census` — but a 0-match proves nothing: see `census_caveat` |
| **What the sideboard answers** | `dossier.threat_profile` + the rest of the cube |
| Filter by color/type/tag/CMC | `cube_search.search_pool(pool, color_identity=core_colors, splash_color_identity=splash_colors, ...)` |
| Query Payoff candidates | Filter working pool cache by `taxonomic_profile.structural_roles` containing `"Payload/Payoff"` |
| Query synergy support | Filter working pool cache by `taxonomic_profile.synergy_clusters` overlap + `"Enabler/Fodder"` or `"Engine/Outlet"` in `structural_roles` |
| **Card resource profile (mana/card economy)** | `taxonomic_profile.resource_exchange` from the working pool — `Mana:`/`Cards:`/`Board:`/`Life:` labels, empty = neutral. Key absent (untagged cube) → derive from oracle text |
| Find commander candidates | `commander_finder.find_commanders(id, color_identity)` |
| Display commander table | `commander_finder.format_commanders_table(candidates)` |
| Run mana audit | `deck_audit.mana_audit(deck_cards, format, commander_cards, core_colors=core_colors, splash_colors=splash_colors)` |
| Display audit report | `deck_audit.format_audit_report(audit)` |
| **Structural gate (curve / assembly / goldfish / coverage)** | `deck_checks.run_structural_checks(...)` + `deck_checks.format_checks_report(report)` — Phase 6b. Thresholds live in `cuber/deck_checks.py`; NEVER re-derive them by hand |
| Verify card exists | Search working pool cache by exact name — never training data |
| Read oracle text | `card.oracle_text` from the working pool cache (you) or the grill bundle (Phase 9 agents) — never training data |
| Write deck files | Write tool → `cubes/<id>/decks/<name>/deck.json` and `deck.tsv`. `exporter.write_mwdeck()` → `deck.mwDeck`. `exporter.write_deck_analysis_md()` → `analysis.md` |
| Write a temp Python script | `_workspace/<run-token>/_tmp_<name>.py` — never to the repo root or shared `_workspace/` root |
